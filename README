Name: vim eyaml-encrypt

Installation: make sure your vimrc sources this file like this: 
==-=-=-=
source {path to script}eyaml-encrypt.vim
=-==-=

A small vim function and (optional) mapping to use the eyaml ruby gem.
As it is currently built, use vim visual to select a string and press F3 to have it replaced by the eyaml equivalent

To make this work, this plugin depends on a couple of things. 
1: nopasswd sudo rights for the eyaml binary, since the keys are stored for only root to read
2: eyaml needs to be installed you can install it by running "gem install hiera-eyaml", the project url can be found here: https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml
3: eyaml configured to automatically find its keys via ~/.eyaml/config.yaml, the config can look lilke this:

---
pkcs7_private_key: '/etc/puppet/secure/keys/private_key.pkcs7.pem'
pkcs7_public_key: '/etc/puppet/secure/keys/public_key.pkcs7.pem'
